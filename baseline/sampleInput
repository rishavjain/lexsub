The 150 Russian football supporters "were well prepared for ultra-rapid, ultra-violent action" and were able to evade arrest, a city prosecutor said.
Five England fans have been jailed for throwing bottles at police and a sixth jailed in connection with the violence.
Two Russians have been arrested, both for a pitch invasion.
Some 35 people have been injured - four seriously, and most of them England fans - and a total of 20 people have been arrested after three days of disorder in the French city.
